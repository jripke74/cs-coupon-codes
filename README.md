STEP 1
Fix the TypeErrors
Travis saved up to buy a new pair of cleats. He wants to make sure he gets the best price, so he built a browser extension to help him compare coupon codes.

The cleats currently cost $99.99, but when Travis runs the program and enters 99.99 at the prompt, he gets a TypeError.

Identify and add the two missing type conversions such that the program runs without any errors.
Recall that you can convert between data types with the str(), int(), and float() functions. The format of the program output should not change.

STEP 2
Round the cents
One more cleanup! Travis notices that the final price often has many decimal places, like 84.9915. He wants to round to the nearest cent.

Round the final price to two decimal places.
Recall that the round() function takes two arguments - the number to round followed by the number of decimal places to round to. For example, round(3.141592, 4) evaluates to 3.1416.
